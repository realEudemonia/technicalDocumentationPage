      <header>What is Web3?</header>
      <p>
        “Web3” is an all-encompassing term that encapsulates cryptocurrencies (digital gold & stablecoins), smart
        contract computing (Layer 1-2 platforms), decentralized hardware infrastructure (video, storage, sensors, etc),
        Non-Fungible Tokens (digital ID & property rights), DeFi (financial services to swap and collateralize web3
        assets), the Metaverse (the digital commons built in game-like environments), and community governance
        (DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris Dixon calls it “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.” Eshita
        describes the Web1 -> Web2 -> Web3 evolution as Read-Only -> Read-Write -> Read-Write-Own.
        Regardless of your preferred shorthand, it might seem intuitive that the user-owned economy will outperform
        the monopolist-owned economy in the long-term.
        <br>
        Essentially, the general theme of web3: we’re going from
        an internet built on “rented land” with monopoly overlords, to an infinite frontier of new possibilities. On
        the frontier, crypto presents a credible revolution to all monopolies, which is why its inevitability scares the
        incumbents.

      <p>
        What is a blockchain?
        A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.
        As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.
        Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin,
        for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
        The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data
        and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.
        <br>
        Another key distinction is private vs. public blockchain. The private blockchains (centralized) have an authorisation scheme to identify which
        participant/user is entering the platform. Thus, only selected members have access to the network.
        On the other hand, in a public blockchain system (decentralized), anyone can join; there are no restrictions when it comes to participation.

      <p>
        A cryptocurrency is a fungible digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
        Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.
        A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune
        to government interference or manipulation.

        A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded.
        Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. Because each token is uniquely identifiable,
        NFTs differ from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

      <<p>
      Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies.
      The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.

        The metaverse is a virtual reality world where users can interact, game and experience things as they would in the real world.
        Using current AR and VR tech, they can immerse into this world and interact with overlaying objects and people in the visual projected in
        front of them.

<!--*User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.-->

<!--*User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.-->

<!--User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.-->
